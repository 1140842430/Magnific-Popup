<h2>What makes it different?</h2>
<div class="features grid-c">

  <div class="gc3">
    <h3>Light and modular</h3>
    <p>You can include in build only features that you need using <a href="#mfp-build-tool" class="mfp-build-tool-link popup-link">online build tool</a> or by compiling it by yourself with Grunt.js. Size of core JS file is 2.8KB + each module weights about 0.5KB (gzipped). Sass CSS preprocessor is used for easier skinning, but you're not obligated to use it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="gc3">
    <h3>Content is resized mostly with CSS</h3>
    <p>The majority of lightbox plugins require you to define size of it via JS option. Magnific Popup does not -  feel free to use relative units like EM's or resize lightbox with help of CSS media queries. Update content inside lightbox without worrying about how it'll resize and center.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="gc3">
    <h3>Fast</h3>
    <p>Magnific Popup displays images before they're completely loaded to take full advantage of progressive loading. For in and out animations CSS3 transitions are used instead of slow jQuery animations.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="gc3">
    <h3>No external graphics</h3>
    <p>By default controls are made just with pure CSS, which makes them not just light, but also high-dpi screen (retina) ready. Surely, you can style everything by yourself however you wish.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="gc3">
    <h3>Conditional lightbox technique</h3>
    <p>Plugin has an option to automatically switch to alternative mobile-friendly source on small screen sizes. Brad Frost has a <a href="http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/conditional-lightbox/">terrific article</a> about this technique.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="gc3">
    <h3>Memory management</h3>
    <p>Popup has an extendable micro templating engine that reuses existing DOM elements, which is expecially useful when you have same pattern for each popup.</p>
  </div>

<h3 style="color:#C00; text-align:center;">Warning! Plugin is in early beta, please don't use it in live projects and wait until I finish it. Please send your suggestions about it via Twitter to <a href="http://twitter.com/dimsemenov">@dimsemenov</a>.</h3>


<!-- <p id="conditional-lightbox-notice"><strong>Your screen size is small and lightbox disabled!</strong> Images, videos and maps now just open direct link to their sources.</p> -->
